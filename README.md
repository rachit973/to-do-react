# To-Do List Application

A full-stack to-do list application built using **React** for the front-end, **Node.js** for the back-end, and **MongoDB** for the database. This application allows users to add, view, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The back-end handles data storage and provides a RESTful API for task management. The app is responsive and designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
